MOODLE_URL=http://localhost:8000
# [optional] An URL at which the microservice can download files from the Moodle
# installation. Normally this is the same as MOODLE_URL, so you don't need to
# set it explicitely. If you run in a network setup in which the microservice
# can't reach the Moodle service through its public URL, you can set the
# internal hostname here. (This is the case if you run Moodle on localhost)
